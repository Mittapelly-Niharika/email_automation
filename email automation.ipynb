    "# **AI Email Automation Agent**\n",
    "\n",
    "Managing an email inbox can be a time-consuming task, especially for busy technical managers who deal with a high volume of communications. This project demonstrates how a sophisticated AI agent can automate common email tasks: summarizing content and scheduling meetings. It aims to reduce manual effort, improve responsiveness, and enhance productivity by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and external API integrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Concepts Demonstrated:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **AI Agent (LangChain Agent):** A system that can dynamically reason, plan, and take actions using a set of tools to achieve a user's goal.\n",
    "*   **Tool Use / Function Calling:** How an LLM can be equipped with external functions (tools) and intelligently decide when and how to use them.\n",
    "*   **Conditional Logic / Intent Recognition:** The agent's ability to understand the intent behind an email (e.g., \"schedule a meeting\" vs. \"summarize\") and choose the appropriate tool.\n",
    "*   **API Integration:** Interacting with real-world services like Gmail and Google Calendar.\n",
    "*   **Robustness & Debugging:** Understanding and overcoming common challenges in AI agent development, such as authentication errors, LLM output formatting, and timezone handling.\n",
    "*   **Custom Prompt Engineering:** Guiding the LLM's behavior with clear and specific instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Setup: Install Required Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to install all the necessary Python libraries. These include:\n",
    "*   `google-api-python-client`, `google-auth-httplib2`, `google-auth-oauthlib`: For interacting with Google's Gmail and Calendar APIs.\n",
    "*   `langchain`, `langchain-google-genai`, `google-generativeai`: For building our AI agent framework and connecting to Google's Gemini LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Action:** Run the following cell to install the dependencies."

    "## 4. Building and Running the Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the entire system comes together. We use LangChain's `create_tool_calling_agent` to link our LLM brain with the tools we've defined. The `AgentExecutor` then runs the core \"Thought -> Action -> Observation\" loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **LLM (Gemini 1.5 Flash):** Our agent's \"brain,\" responsible for reasoning, understanding instructions, and deciding which tools to use.\n",
    "*   **Tools:** The list of functions (`get_unread_emails`, `schedule_meeting`, `summarize_email`) that the LLM can call.\n",
    "*   **Custom Prompt:** We use a `ChatPromptTemplate` to give explicit instructions to the LLM. This prompt was crucial for making the agent reliably use its tools and prevent \"hallucinations\" where it would just talk about taking action instead of actually doing it. It also provides important context like today's date and the user's timezone.\n",
    "*   **`create_tool_calling_agent`:** This is the modern LangChain construct optimized for models like Gemini that excel at generating structured tool calls (JSON). It correctly parses the LLM's output and passes arguments to our tools.\n",
    "*   **`AgentExecutor`:** The runtime that executes the agent's decision-making process. `verbose=True` is enabled to show the agent's internal thoughts and tool invocations, which is invaluable for understanding and debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Run:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Ensure you have some **unread emails** in your Gmail inbox:\n",
    "    *   At least one clear meeting request (e.g., \"Can we meet tomorrow at 3 PM for 45 minutes to discuss Project X? My email is person@example.com\").\n",
    "    *   At least one informational email (e.g., a newsletter or report).\n",
    "    *   Optionally, some junk mail.\n",
    "2.  **Run this cell.** Observe the detailed verbose output as the agent processes each email, decides whether to schedule, summarize, or ignore, and finally reports its actions.\n"
